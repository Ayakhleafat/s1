The difference between section and div:
major difference is semantics.
<section> is semantic , <div> is non-semantic.
<div> is a generic container element that does not carry any semantic meaning.
The <section> tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.


The difference between paragraph and article:
<p> creates a new paragraph.
<article> is basically only a container, alone it does not do anything, it just helps to keep the website organized.
